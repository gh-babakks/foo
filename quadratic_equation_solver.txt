How to Solve a Quadratic Equation in Shell
============================================

A quadratic equation has the form: ax² + bx + c = 0

The quadratic formula is: x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

This document explains how to solve quadratic equations using shell scripting.

Basic Concepts
--------------
1. The discriminant: Δ = b² - 4ac
   - If Δ > 0: Two distinct real solutions
   - If Δ = 0: One repeated real solution
   - If Δ < 0: Two complex solutions

2. The solutions are:
   - x₁ = (-b + √Δ) / 2a
   - x₂ = (-b - √Δ) / 2a

Shell Script Implementation
---------------------------

Here's a complete shell script to solve quadratic equations:

#!/bin/bash

# Quadratic Equation Solver
# Solves equations of the form: ax² + bx + c = 0

echo "Quadratic Equation Solver"
echo "Solves: ax² + bx + c = 0"
echo

# Read coefficients
read -p "Enter coefficient a: " a
read -p "Enter coefficient b: " b
read -p "Enter coefficient c: " c

# Check if a is zero
if [ $(echo "$a == 0" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "Error: 'a' cannot be zero for a quadratic equation"
    exit 1
fi

# Calculate discriminant: b² - 4ac
discriminant=$(echo "$b * $b - 4 * $a * $c" | bc)

echo
echo "Discriminant (Δ) = $discriminant"

# Check the nature of roots based on discriminant
if [ $(echo "$discriminant > 0" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then
    # Two distinct real roots
    echo "The equation has two distinct real roots"
    
    sqrt_discriminant=$(echo "scale=10; sqrt($discriminant)" | bc -l)
    x1=$(echo "scale=4; (-1 * $b + $sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * $a)" | bc -l)
    x2=$(echo "scale=4; (-1 * $b - $sqrt_discriminant) / (2 * $a)" | bc -l)
    
    echo "x₁ = $x1"
    echo "x₂ = $x2"
    
elif [ $(echo "$discriminant == 0" | bc) -eq 1 ]; then
    # One repeated real root
    echo "The equation has one repeated real root"
    
    x=$(echo "scale=4; -1 * $b / (2 * $a)" | bc -l)
    echo "x = $x"
    
else
    # Complex roots
    echo "The equation has two complex roots"
    
    real_part=$(echo "scale=4; -1 * $b / (2 * $a)" | bc -l)
    abs_discriminant=$(echo "$discriminant * -1" | bc)
    sqrt_abs_discriminant=$(echo "scale=10; sqrt($abs_discriminant)" | bc -l)
    imaginary_part=$(echo "scale=4; $sqrt_abs_discriminant / (2 * $a)" | bc -l)
    
    echo "x₁ = $real_part + ${imaginary_part}i"
    echo "x₂ = $real_part - ${imaginary_part}i"
fi

Usage Examples
--------------

Example 1: Two distinct real roots
Equation: x² - 5x + 6 = 0
Coefficients: a=1, b=-5, c=6
Solution: x₁ = 3, x₂ = 2

Example 2: One repeated root
Equation: x² - 4x + 4 = 0
Coefficients: a=1, b=-4, c=4
Solution: x = 2

Example 3: Complex roots
Equation: x² + 2x + 5 = 0
Coefficients: a=1, b=2, c=5
Solution: x₁ = -1 + 2i, x₂ = -1 - 2i

Requirements
------------
- bash shell
- bc (basic calculator) command must be installed
  Install on Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install bc
  Install on RHEL/CentOS: sudo yum install bc
  Install on macOS: bc is typically pre-installed

Tips for Using the Script
--------------------------
1. Save the script to a file (e.g., quadratic_solver.sh)
2. Make it executable: chmod +x quadratic_solver.sh
3. Run the script: ./quadratic_solver.sh
4. Enter the coefficients when prompted
5. The script will calculate and display the solutions

Mathematical Notes
------------------
- The bc command is used for floating-point arithmetic
- scale=4 sets precision to 4 decimal places
- sqrt() function calculates square root
- The script handles all three cases: positive, zero, and negative discriminant
- For complex numbers, the real and imaginary parts are calculated separately
