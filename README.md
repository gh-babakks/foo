## OS Information Script

The `os_info.sh` script provides comprehensive operating system information including:

- System hostname and architecture
- Operating system name, release, and kernel version
- CPU model and core count
- Memory usage information
- Disk usage statistics
- System uptime
- Current date and time

### Usage

To run the OS information script:

```bash
./os_info.sh
```

The script is compatible with most Unix/Linux systems and will gracefully handle missing information sources.
